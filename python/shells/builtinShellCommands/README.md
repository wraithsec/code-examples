# DESC
An attempt to create a shell with builtin commands and use a library for it as well. 


# INSTALL

```
python3 -m venv venv
. venv/bin/activate 
pip3 install prompt_toolkit
python3 myshell.py
```

# EXTRA
noInitCmdClass.py and InitCmdClass.py are examples of how you'd get a list of available commands potentially from within a class/subclass structure. Its really rough and shit. But its POC of how to do it for me.
